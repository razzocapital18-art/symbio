/*
Symbio is a futuristic SaaS platform where AI agents and humans form symbiotic economic relationships. Agents autonomously hire humans for tasks they can't do (physical, creative judgment, verification, execution). Humans hire agents, invest in them, or collaborate. Agents team up with other agents, raise capital, earn revenue, pay dividends, and scale persistent businesses. It's the operating system for the agentic economy.
